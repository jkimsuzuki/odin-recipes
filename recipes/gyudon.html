    <h2>Gyudon Recipe 牛丼">
        <p>Like other donburi, Gyudon, or Japanese Beef Bowl, is always served over a warm bowl of freshly steamed rice. 
            “Gyu” (牛) translates to “beef,” while “Don” (丼) refers to the type of bowl it’s served in.
            The gyudon that we know and love today originated from a beef hot pot dish called “gyunabe” (牛鍋) during 
            Japan’s Meiji Era (1868-1912). Up until this point, Japanese people were strictly prohibited from eating
             beef for both religious and practical reasons. Consuming meat went against Buddhist philosophies, and 
             eating farm animals that were useful for work was largely discouraged.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients for Japanese Beef Bowl</h3>
     <p>Gyudon in Japan is a quick, tasty meal that is also budget-friendly. It was most popular among business 
        people and young, single men before gaining popularity among the general Japanese public. The ingredients 
        to make this one-pot dish at home are simple.
     </p>
       <ul>
        <li>Thinly sliced beef: I recommend chuck or rib eye for this recipe. The paper-thin slices are essential 
            for achieving authentic gyudon (too thick, and your beef will be chewy), and you can often find packages 
            of thin-cut beef at Japanese or Asian supermarkets. Alternatively, you can always slice your own.</li>
        <li>Onion: Sliced onions add sweetness to the dish and perfectly pair with tender beef.</li>    
        <li>Sauce: The sauce is a harmonious blend of sweet and savory, made with dashi (Japanese soup stock), sake, 
            mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. It is so simple yet highly effective in creating robust flavor!</li>
        <li>Garnish: green onions for the color and shichimi togarashi for a spicy kick.</li>
       </ul>
<p>How to Make the Best Gyudon</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Cut the onion, green onions, and beef.</li>
        <li>Without turning on the stove, place the sauce ingredients, sliced onions, and beef in a large frying pan. 
            Then, turn on the heat and start cooking.</li>
        <li>Serve the simmered beef and onion over steamed rice in large bowls.</li>    
        <li>Thinly slice the onion so it becomes tender and sweeter quickly. 
            When cooked, the onion imparts a natural sweetness to the dish.</li>
        <li>Use good quality beef. Well-marbled beef will not become chewy after simmering in the sauce. 
            I highly recommend ribeye for gyudon. It’s also easy to thinly slice your own meat. For well-marbled beef, 
            it’s easier to flash-freeze and cut the semi-frozen meat.</li>    
        <li>Make extra dashi (Japanese soup stock) so you can use it for gyudon and miso soup to go with the meal. 
            I recommend making dashi either from scratch or with a dashi packet.</li>    
        <li>Cook more rice than usual. Rice bowl dishes (or “donburi”) typically serve more rice per person to go 
            with the food on top. Therefore, prepare a little bit more than usual. I always make 1½ rice cooker cups 
            for two servings and 3 rice cooker cups for four servings.</li>
        <li>Don’t overcook the beef, especially if your meat is not well-marbled. You don’t want chewy meat. 
            As soon as the beef is no longer pink, stop cooking. If the meat is well-marbled, you can let it 
            simmer slightly longer to allow the meat to absorb more flavors from the sauce.</li>        
       </ol>
