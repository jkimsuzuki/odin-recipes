    <h2>Takoyaki Recipe たこ焼き</h2>
    <p>Takoyaki, or Grilled Octopus Balls, originated in Osaka and are one of Japan’s best-known street foods. 
        Whether you make a traditional style with bits of octopus or choose creative alternatives, 
        these ball-shaped dumplings are fun to make with your friends and family! 
        Takoyaki (たこ焼き) is a Japanese snack in the shape of little round balls containing pieces of octopus. 
        Tako-yaki literally translates to “octopus-grilled/fried” 
        and some people may call it “Grilled Octopus Balls” or “Octopus Dumplings”.
